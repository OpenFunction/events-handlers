# OpenFunction Events Handlers

This repository is used to store the code for events handlers in the OpenFunction event framework.

We provide two types of events handlers, one for events fetched from the event source (eventsource handler) and one for events fetched from the event bus (trigger handler).

The purpose of putting event handlers in a standalone repository is to make them work as OpenFunction functions.

## EventSource Handler

To learn more about **EventSource**, refer to [this document](https://github.com/OpenFunction/OpenFunction/blob/main/docs/concepts/OpenFunction-events-framework.md#eventsource).

To learn how to use this handler, refer to [this document](eventsource).
